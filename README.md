# Student-Portal
An application that registers and shows students fees

This mobile application operates on a slidding window tabbed layout with three interfaces (whatsapp layout inspiration)
It connects to firebase realtime databases to store:
*student details for registration in the first layout dubbed student registration, 
*student course details for student course registration in the second tab,
*Fee status calculated from data in firebase regarding the number of courses they have been registered in
